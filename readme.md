# Patientor_fullstack

Patientor app containing server and client code, both in TypeScript  
Ex 11.20 and 11.21 of  
https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11/

## Request for feedback

would appreciate feedback on how the types are handled (= shared types.ts and client-specific types.ts)

### Memo

Should mui complain, check if those are needed:  
@mui/x-date-pickers-pro  
@types/eslint\_\_js  
potential problem with <Grid> (was <Grid item> before and just changed it)
